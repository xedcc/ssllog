HOW TO CREATE ORACLE INSTANCE.


Install ec2-api-tools on your local machine.

ec2-run-instances ami-d0f89fb9 -t t1.micro -z us-east-1a -b /dev/sda1=none -b /dev/sda1=<snap-id>::false:standard -O <Access Key ID> -W <Secret Access Key>




HOW TO CHECK THE INTEGRITY OF THE ORACLE EBS SNAPSHOT.

Launch a new instance Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 LTS 64 bit AMI ID ami-d0f89fb9.
Wait for the instance to initialize and "Status Checks" showing "2/2 checks passed".
Stop the instance, wait for the state to become "Stopped", and detach the volume.
Wait for the volume state to become "available" and attach the volume to any running instance.

From within the running instance "sudo mount" the volume and perform file system changes to the mounted volume:
(The folowing needs to be deleted as files in those locations will always vary between instances of the same AMI.)

delete and recreate /dev with permissions 755 root:root
rm /etc/hostname 
rm -r /var/log
rm -r /var/lib/cloud
rm -r /var/lib/dhcp
rm -r /var/lib/plymouth
rm -r /var/lib/urandom
rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
rm /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm /home/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

Copy the following files from git's oracle directory making sure the permissions match:
 
rc.local        to /etc/rc.local 	 perm 755	
ssh.conf        to /etc/init/ssh.conf  	 perm 644 
sshd_config     to /etc/ssh/sshd_config	 perm 644
authorized_keys to /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys perm 600
oracle.py       to /home/ubuntu		 perm 600
stub.py         to /home/ubuntu		 perm 600
stcppipe.zip    to /home/ubuntu		 perm 600

Now compare hashes from the modified snapshot to hashes of oracle-snapshot. First hash file/directory/symlink paths, ownership, permissions, and symlink targets then hash the contents of all regular files.

cd into the root directory of the mounted volume , e.g. cd /mnt/myvolume

find . -printf '%h %f %U %G %m %l\n' | sha256sum
758d7f4f6e9283607a30ce779e7e5bd4429106a9d98336471cedbea8eccd09de

find . -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum | sha256sum

HOW TO PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT A CERTAIN IP ADDRESS IS RUNNING THE ORACLE INSTANCE.

USing aws_query.py create and make public GET strings for requests DescribeInstances and DescribeVolumes.
